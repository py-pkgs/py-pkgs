    "Python packages are the fundamental units of shareable code in Python. Packages make it easy to organize, reuse, and maintain your code, as well as share it between projects, with your colleagues, and with the wider Python community. *Python Packages* is an open source book that describes modern and efficient workflows for creating Python packages. The focus of this book is overwhelmingly practical; we will demonstrate methods and tools you can use to develop and maintain packages quickly, reproducibly, and with as much automation as possible - so you can focus on writing and sharing code!"

    "Despite their importance, packages can be difficult to understand and cumbersome to create for beginners and seasoned developers alike. This book aims to describe the packaging process at an accessible and practical level for data scientists, developers, and programmers. Along the way, we'll develop a real Python package and will explore all the key elements of Python packaging, including; creating a package file and directory structure, when and why to write tests and documentation, and how to maintain and update your package with the help of automated continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading this book, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand what Python packages are, and when and why you should use them.\n",
    "- Be able to build your own Python package from scratch.\n",
    "- Learn how to document your Python code and packages.\n",
    "- Write software tests for your code, and automate them.\n",
    "- Learn how to release your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and discover best practices for updating and versioning your code.\n",
    "- Implement CI/CD workflows to build, test, and deploy your package automatically.\n",
    "- Get tips on Python coding style, best-practice packaging workflows, and other useful development tools."

While we aim to make the packaging workflows and concepts discussed in this book tool-agnostic, the tools we do use in the book may have been updated by the time you read it. If the maintainers of these tools are doing the right thing by documenting, versioning, and properly deprecating their code (we'll explore these concepts ourselves in **Chapter 7: {ref}`07:Releasing-and-versioning`**), then it should be straightforward to adapt any outdated code in the book."

Without you all, this book wouldn't be nearly as good as it is, and we are deeply grateful.

We hope that *Python Packages* will eventually play a similar role in the Python community."
