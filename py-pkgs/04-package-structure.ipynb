The `__init__.py` file is required to make Python treat the directory as a package (or sub-package). It is common for `__init__.py` files to be empty and simply there only to tell Python that a directory should be treated as a package, but they can also contain helpful initialization code to run when your package is imported, and we'll discuss that more in the next section. \n",

Similarly, some packages will ship a `tests` folder as part of their package, while others will share them separately (via a service like GitHub) for those who actually wish to develop on the package, rather than just use it.

Discussing how `pip` works is beyond the scope of this book (although interested readers can read about it in the [`pip` documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)), but at this point, it's important to note that one of the most powerful features of Python is its ability to interoperate with libraries written in other languages, for example, C. Developers sometimes choose to take advantage of this interoperability and include code from other languages in their package to make their code faster, access libraries written in other languages, and generally improve the functionality of their code. While Python is typically referred to as an interpreted language (i.e., your Python code is translated to machine code as it is executed), languages such as C require compilation before they can be used (i.e., your code must be translated into \"machine code\" *before* it can be executed). Source distributions are \"unbuilt\" and require a build step before they can be installed - this basically means compiling the source code and extracting out package metadata. For packages written in pure Python, sdists are a perfectly acceptable way to distribute your package. However, for packages relying on any non-Python code, many users may not have the tools, experience, or time to build the package containing code written in other languages (typically called \"extensions\").\n",

    "A useful analogy for all this is to imagine making a cake. A pure Python source distribution is a boxed cake mix: simply add liquid and bake. In contrast, an sdist relying on non-Python code is a collection of all the individual ingredients (flour, eggs, butter, etc.) and requires more time, effort, expertise, and tools to make the cake. At this point, you may be thinking - wouldn't it just be easier if you could distribute the baked cake, so users don't have to make it at all? Well, that would be a \"built distribution\"."

    "A built distribution is a distribution containing source files and metadata that has been pre-built and so do not require a build step before installation (unlike sdists) - they only need to be moved to the correct location on your system to be installed. The main built distribution format used by Python is the `wheel`, denoted with the extension `.whl`, and it is the preferred method of distribution in  Python. In fact, `pip` always prefers wheels because installation is simpler and faster, even for pure-Python packages (which don't require compilation of non-Python code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Built distributions containing non-Python code are built for specific operating systems (because different operating systems require different machine code). However, developers don't typically build a wheel for every single operating system, only the most common ones. For this reason, built distributions are usually provided with their corresponding source distributions; if a wheel isn't available for a particular operating system, users will still be able to (try to) build the package from source. As an example, take a look at the downloadable distributions of [`NumPy` on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files) - you'll see `wheels` for most common platforms, as well as a source distribution at the bottom of the list. There are actually three types of wheels depending on how specific they are to a version of Python and/or an operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Universal wheels*: pure-Python and support Python 2 and 3. Can be installed anywhere using `pip`; \n",
    "2. *Pure Python wheels*: pure-Python but don’t support both Python 2 and 3; and,\n",
    "3. *Platform wheels*: binary package distributions specific to certain platforms as a result of containing compiled extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell a lot about a `wheel` from the name itself which follows a [strict naming convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#file-name-convention): `{distribution}-{version}(-{build tag})?-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl`. For example, the `NumPy` wheel `numpy-1.18.1-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl` tells us that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution is `numpy v1.18.1`;\n",
    "- It is made for Python 3.7;\n",
    "- It is specific to the `macosx_10_9_x86_64` platform (i.e, this is a \"platform wheel\" because it is platform-specific).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our current `partypy` wheel `partypy-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution is `partypy v0.1.0`;\n",
    "- It is made for Python 3+;\n",
    "- It is not specific to any one operating system, `any` (it is a pure-Python wheel).\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of readers will never deal with building extensions in other languages for their Python package, and so won't have to worry about making different built distributions of their package - the default outputs and configuration of modern packaging tools like `poetry` will take care of everything. However, we refer those interested in learning more to the [Python Packaging Authority guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-binary-extensions/)."

    "\"Installing\" a package (e.g., by `pip install XXX`) is really a two-step process: 1) building the package (in the case of an `sdist`), and 2) installing the package. Using wheels takes out the first step, meaning we only need to install. The install step is fairly simple, it essentially copies the decompressed package files to the chosen installation directory, the default of which varies by platform and by how you installed Python.\n",

However, it's a nice way to learn about the package installation process, so if you'd like to give it a go, you can try the following steps (which are based on using the MacOS and [`conda` package manager](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)):\n",

In the code below we'll `cd` into the test environment's install location, download this wheel, and unzip it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{prompt} bash \\$ auto\n",
    "    $ cd /opt/miniconda3/envs/manualpkg/lib/python3.7/site-packages\n",

    "    $ unzip toy_pkg-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This will result in two new unzipped directories: `toy_pkg` and `toy_pkg-0.0.1.dist-info`. From the terminal we can now start a Python session and try importing this package: \n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. You can remove the `conda` virtual environment if you wish with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{prompt} bash \\$ auto\n",
    "    $ conda deactivate\n",

    "The focus of this book is on workflows and tools that make packaging accessible and efficient. `poetry` is one of those tools. It abstract much of the lower-level details away from the packager and provides an easy-to-use CLI to develop, build, and publish a package - so developers can focus on writing code and not worry about the nuances of sharing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tool worth mentioning here is `flit`. `flit` is a slightly stripped down version of `poetry` in that it is a Python package that provides a simple tool to put Python packages and modules on PyPI. It is similarly configured with the `pyproject.toml` file and provides CLI commands such as `build`, `install`, and `publish`. At the time of writing, the main difference between `flit` and `poetry` is that `flit` doesn’t help you manage or resolve dependencies. This is a useful feature, especially for beginner and intermediate packagers, which is why we typically choose to use `poetry` for our package development. `poetry` also implicitly supports the use of virtual environments but this is a feature we haven't used in this book, in favor of using `conda`. This is mostly personal choice but `conda` can be used with `flit` for example, illustrating one of the reasons we chose to use it - it's universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A caveat on the use of `poetry` and `flit` is that, at the time of writing, they only support pure Python projects. This will be completely fine for the vast majority of prospective packagers. However, for those looking to build more advanced packages that include non-Python code, we recommend reading this documentation from the [Python Packaging Authority](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-binary-extensions/#cross-platform-wheel-generation-with-scikit-build)."
