They are typically structured as a directory (the package) containing one or more  *.py* files (the modules) and/or subdirectories (which we call subpackages). A special file named *`__init__.py`*\\index{init.py} is used to tell Python that a directory is a package (rather than just a plain-old directory on your computer). We'll talk more about the *`__init__.py`* file and package structure in **{numref}`04:Package-structure`**, but for now, here's an example of a simple package structure with two modules and one subpackage:\n",

For example, let's import the `pycounts` package we created in **Chapter 3: {ref}`03:How-to-package-a-Python`** and check its type (recall that this package contains two modules; *`pycounts.py`* and *`plotting.py`*): \n",

    "As we discussed in **{numref}`04:Packaging-fundamentals`**, packages are a way of organizing and accessing a collection of modules. Fundamentally, a package is identified as a directory containing an *`__init__.py`*\\index{init.py} file, and a module is a file with a *.py* extension that contains Python code. Below is an example directory structure of a simple Python package with two modules and a subpackage:\n",

    "    └── module2.py\n",

    "The *`__init__.py`* tells Python to treat a directory as a package (or subpackage). It is common for *`__init__.py`* files to be empty, but they can also contain helpful initialization code to run when your package is imported, as we'll discuss in **{numref}`04:The-init-file`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above structure satisfies the criteria for a Python package, and you would be able to `import`\\index{import} content from this package on your local computer if it was in the current working directory (or if its path had been manually added to `sys.path`). But this package lacks the content required to make it installable\\index{installable Python package}. \n",

    "To create an installable package, we need a tool capable of installing and building packages. Currently the most common tools used for package development are `poetry`\\index{poetry}, `flit`\\index{flit}, and `setuptools`\\index{setuptools}. In this book, we use `poetry` but we'll compare these tools later in **{numref}`04:Packaging-tools`**. Regardless of the tool you use, it will rely on a configuration file(s) that defines the metadata and installation instructions for your package. In a `poetry`-managed project that file is the *`pyproject.toml`*\\index{pyproject.toml}. It's also good practice to include a README in your package's root directory to provide high-level information about the package, and to put the Python code of your package in a *`src/`* directory (we'll discuss why this is in **{numref}`04:The-source-layout`**).

You can read about this function in the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.resources.path); it is used in a `with` statement and requires two parameters, the location of the subpackage the data is in (`\"pycounts.data\"`) and the name of the data file to access within that subpackage (`\"flatland.txt\"`).

We list a few of these below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For developers using a testing framework like `pytest`, a \"src\" layout forces you to install your package before it can be tested. Most developers would agree that you would want to test your package as it will be installed by users, rather than as it currently exists on your own machine. The problem with a \"non-src\" layout is that Python can `import` your package even if it is not installed. This is because in most cases the first place Python searches when running `import` is the current directory (check this by importing `sys` and running `sys.path[0]`). Without a \"src\" folder, Python will find your package as it exists in the current directory and import it, rather than using it as it would be installed on a user's machine. There are plenty of horror stories of developers uploading broken distributions to PyPI because they were testing their code as it existed on their machine rather than as it would be installed by users. This issue is described in detail in Ionel Cristian Mărieș' [Packaging a Python Library](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/) and Hynek Schlawack's [Testing and Packaging](https://hynek.me/articles/testing-packaging/) excellent blog posts for those interested.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. A \"src\" layout leads to cleaner editable installs of your package. Recall from **{numref}`03:Installing-your-package`** that when developing a package, it's common to install it in editable mode (the default when running `poetry install`). This adds the path to your project's Python code to the `sys.path` list so that changes to your source code are immediately available when you `import` it, without needing to reinstall.  With a \"src\" layout that path looks something like this:\n",

    "So the question is, how do we provide the *`{package}`* and *`{package}-{version}.dist-info`* directories necessary to install our package? There are two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a single archive of all our package source code, metadata, and instructions on how to create the *`{package}`* and *`{package}-{version}.dist-info`* directories, and then share that archive with users. This is called a source distribution or sdist\\index{distribution!sdists}. To install your package from an sdist, a user needs to download the archive, unpack it, and use the included build instructions to build it into the *`{package}`* and *`{package}-{version}.dist-info`* directories on their own computer (we'll talk about how these directories are \"built\" in **{numref}`04:Building-sdists-and-wheels`**). Finally, the package is installed by copying these directories to the *`site-packages/`* directory.\n",
    "2. Build the *`{package}`* and *`{package}-{version}.dist-info`* directories on our own machine, compress them into a single file, and share them with users. This single file is called a wheel\\index{distribution!wheel}. A user just needs to download the wheel and extract the contents to the *`site-packages/`* folder, no build step is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install`\\index{pip} can handle installation from an sdist or a wheel, but distributing your package to users as a wheel (option 2) certainly seems preferable; everything has already been done on the developer's side and installation just involves downloading the distribution and copying it to the appropriate location on a user's computer. This is why wheels are the preferred distribution format for Python packages. In fact, when you run `pip install <some-package>`, it will always prioritize installing the specified package from a wheel (if it exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you might be wondering why we bother with sdists at all. The reason is that wheels aren't always available to users. Some Python packages contain \"extensions\" written in other languages, such as C/C++, because they offer functionality and performance enhancements. While Python is typically referred to as an interpreted language (i.e., your Python code is translated to machine code as it is executed), languages such as C/C++ require compilation by a compiler program before they can be used (i.e., your code must be translated into \"machine code\" *before* it can be executed). Compilation is platform-specific. Thus, if a developer wanted to provide wheels of a package that included extensions in another language, they would have to generate one wheel for each platform they wanted to support (e.g., MacOS-arm64, MacOS-x86, Win-32, Win-amd64, etc.). For this reason, sdists are usually provided with wheels; if a wheel isn't available for a user's particular platform, they will still be able to build the package from the sdist (which would require that they have the appropriate compiling program(s)).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the popular `numpy` package contains extensions written in C, so its wheels are platform-specific. Wheels have a specific naming convention (described in [PEP 427](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/)) which includes the name of the platform they support; if you look at `numpy`'s [distributions on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files), you'll see wheels for common platforms, as well as an sdist at the bottom of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wheels specific to a platform are known as \"platform wheels\". However, the vast majority of Python packages use pure Python code (i.e., they don't include extensions written in other languages), and so don't need to worry about generating platform wheels. Most developers and readers of this book will only ever generate one wheel for their package; a \"universal wheel\" (compatible with Python 2 and 3) or a \"pure Python wheel\" (compatible with either Python 2 or 3). The build tool you use to make your distributions will handle wheel creation for you (as we'll talk about in the next section), so it's not something you need to worry about, but it's interesting to know these things!"

    "This table specifies the tools required to build the sdist and wheel for a package (`requires`) and where the functions that actually do the build are located in a build-tool's library (`build-backend`). For example, the table above shows that the `poetry-core` library is require to build our package, and that the building functions are located in `poetry.core.masonry.api`. If you take a look at the source code of `poetry-core`'s `poetry.core.masonry.api` [module](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/blob/master/poetry/core/masonry/api.py), you'll see functions like `build_wheel()` and `build_sdist()`. The exact building mechanics are beyond the scope of this book so we wont go into detail about how they work. However, as a packaging book, it would be remiss not to mention that the ability to specify the build tools required to make sdists and wheels of a package is a relatively new development in the packaging ecosystem. This functionality was introduced in [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) and [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/), to remove the dependency of the packaging system on legacy tools. These PEPs are an interesting read for those keen on digging into more of the low-level details of building and installing package distributions."

It is also managed by a *`pyproject.toml`* file and provides commands similar to `poetry` to help install a package (`flit install`), build distributions (`flit build`), and publish those distributions to a repository like PyPI (`flit publish`). The main difference between `flit` and `poetry` is that `flit` doesn't automatically manage the dependencies of your project like `poetry` does; you have to manually add dependencies and their version specifications to *`pyproject.toml`*. As a result, we prefer `poetry` because it means there's one less thing to worry about!\n",

However, for those looking to build more advanced packages that include non-Python code, `setuptools`\\index{setuptools} is the preferred option. For a long time `setuptools` was the default build tool for Python packages so it is still used by many projects that have been around for a while. `setuptools` require a little more expertise to configure than `poetry` or `flit`, as you can read more about in the [documentation](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/index.html), so we prefer `poetry` or `flit` for packaging projects where possible."

Packages on these repositories can be installed from the command line using `conda install`\\index{conda} (we installed the `conda` tool in **{numref}`02:Installing-Python`**). The main differences between PyPI and these repositories is that they can host non-Python software (as opposed to PyPI which only hosts Python software), and `conda` packages are binaries (there is never a need to have to build a package or its dependencies from an sdist). As a result, packages that depend on non-Python code are usually released to Anaconda or conda-forge. Even for packages that are pure Python, developers sometimes still also create a `conda` package and upload to Anaconda or conda-forge to cater to users who are using `conda` as a package manager rather than `pip`. For those interested, Anaconda provides a helpful [tutorial](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html) to help convert packages on PyPI to `conda` packages, but for most readers of this book, building sdist and wheel distributions and sharing them on PyPI will be enough.\n",

    "In some cases, you may want to release your package to a private repository (for example, for internal use by your company only). There are many private repository options for Python packages. Companies like [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/), [PyDist](https://pydist.com/) and [GemFury](https://gemfury.com/) are all examples that offer (typically paid) private Python package repository hosting. You can also set up your own server on a dedicated machine or cloud service — as discussed in this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-install-a-private-pypi-server-on-aws-76993e45c610). You can also choose to host your package on GitHub (or equivalent), and forego releasing to a dedicated software repository. `pip install` supports installing a package directly from a GitHub repository you have access to, as discussed in the [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/). You can `pip install` from a repository branch, a specific commit, or a tag. For example, we tagged a release of v0.1.0 of our `pycounts` package on GitHub in **{numref}`03:Tagging-a-package-release-with-version-control`**.

    "Installing from GitHub can be useful for users wanting a version of your package not yet available on PyPI (for example, a development version), or if you want to host your package in a private repository and only share it with a select few collaborators. In general though, we don't recommend GitHub for sharing Python packages to a wide audience as the vast majority of Python users do not install packages from GitHub, and dedicated software repositories like PyPI provide better discoverability, ease of installation, and a stamp of authenticity."
