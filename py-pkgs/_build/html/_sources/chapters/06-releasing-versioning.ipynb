In the {ref}`02-whole-game` we briefly showed how to release a package to PyPI, Python's main package index.

    "When you're ready to release your software, you first need to decide where to release it to. The Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)) is the official, open-source, software repository for Python (as CRAN is the repository for R). If you're interested in sharing your work publicly, this is probably where you'll be releasing your package. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on releasing packages to PyPI in this chapter, however PyPI is not the only option. Another popular software repository for Python (and other languages) packages is that hosted by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and accessible with the [conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (which we installed back in {ref}`01-python-setup`). We won't go into the details of the differences between these two popular repositories here, but if you're interested to read more, we recommend [this article](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip#:~:text=Pip%20installs%20Python%20packages%20whereas,software%20written%20in%20any%20language.&text=Another%20key%20difference%20between%20the,the%20packages%20installed%20in%20them.). Creating packages for Anaconda requires a little more work than for PyPI - Anaconda provides a [helpful tutorial](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html) on the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you may want to release your package to a private repository (for example, for internal use by your company only). There are many private repository options for Python packages. Companies like [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/), [PyDist](https://pydist.com/) and [GemFury](https://gemfury.com/) are all examples that offer (typically paid) private Python package repository hosting. You can also set up your own server on a dedicated machine or cloud service like AWS - read more [here](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-install-a-private-pypi-server-on-aws-76993e45c610).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also choose to simply host your package on GitHub (or equivalent), and forego releasing to a dedicated software repository like PyPI. In some cases, it is possible for users to `pip install` directly from a GitHub repository (read [this excellent article](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/11/pip-install-from-a-git-repository/) to learn more). For example, to install the `pypkgs` package directly from GitHub:\n",

    "$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/TomasBeuzen/pypkgs.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "We don't recommend GitHub for sharing Python packages to a wide audience as the install workflow can often be problematic, the vast majority of Python users do not install packages from GitHub, and dedicated software repositories like PyPI provide better discoverability, ease of installation and a stamp of authenticity.\n",

    "Versioning is the process of adding unique identifiers to different versions of your package. The unique identifier you use may be name-based or number-based. Python prefers number-based schemes and we saw an example of this in {ref}`02-whole-game` chapter where we assigned our `pypkgs` package an intial version number of 0.1.0 (the default when using the `poetry` package manager). This three-number versioning scheme (also referred to as semantic versioning) is the most common scheme used and the idea is to incrementally increase the version number in a logical way as you make changes to your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do make changes to your package, how do you decide how to increment the version? Will our next version be 0.1.1, 0.2.0, or 1.1.0? Here are the general guidelines for increment package version:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patch release (0.1.`X+1`): patches are typically small changes to your package that do not add any significant new features, for example, a small bug fix or documentation change that do not change backward compatibility (the compatibility of your package with previous versions of itself). It's fine to have so many patch releases that you need to use two (e.g., 0.1.10) or even three (e.g., 0.1.127) digits!\n",
    "- Minor release (0.`X+1`.0): a minor release may include bug fixes, new package features and changes in backward compatibility.\n",
    "- Major release (`X+1`.1.0): used when you make major changes that are not backward compatible and are likely to affect many users. Typically, when you come to versioning from 0.x.y to 1.0.0, this indicates that your package is feature-complete with a stable API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org/). Note that there are many variations of semantic versioning. For example, often software packages will include alpha/beta/candidate release versions (e.g., 1.1.0-alpha.0) or development versions (e.g., 1.0.dev1). [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#examples-of-compliant-version-schemes) contains examples of all the Python-compliant version identifier schemes. We'll show how to increment your package version with `poetry` in section {ref}`06-releasing`."

    "As discussed above, minor and major version releases often come with backward compatible changes which will affect your package's user base. The impact and importance of backward compatibility is directly proportional to the number of people using your package. That's not to say that you should avoid backward compatible changes - there are good reasons for making these changes, such as improving software design mistakes, improving functionality, or making code simpler and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do need to make a backward incompatible change, it might be best to implement that change gradually, by providing adequate warning and advice to your package's user base through deprecation warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can add a deprecation warning to our code quite easily by using the [`warnings` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) in the Python standard library. If you've been following along with the `pypkgs` package we've been developing in this book, we could add a deprecation warning to our `catbind()` function by simpling importing the `warnings` module and adding a `FutureWarning` in our code:\n",
    "\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "    return pd.Categorical(concatenated)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to run our code now, we would see the `FutureWarning` printed to our output. If you've used any larger Python libraries before (such as `NumPy`, `Pandas` or `scikit-learn`) you probably have seen these warnings before! On that note, these large, established Python libraries offer great resources for learning how to properly manage your own package - don't be afraid to check out their source code and history on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from pypkgs import pypkgs\n",
    ">>> import pandas as pd\n",
    ">>> a = pd.Categorical([\"character\", \"hits\", \"your\", \"eyeballs\"])\n",

    "eyeballs, hits, integer, where it, your]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other things to think about when making backward compatability changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you're changing a function significantly, consider keeping both the legacy (with a deprecation warning) and new version of the function for a few versions to help users make a smoother transition to using the new function.\n",
    "- If you're deprecating a lot of code, consider doing it in small increments over mutliple releases.\n",
    "- If your backward incompatible change is a result of one of your package's dependencies changing, it is often better to warn your users that they require a newer version of a dependency rather than immediately making it a required dependency (which might break a users' other code).\n",
    "- Documentation is key! Don't be afraid to be verbose about documenting backward incompatible changes in your package documentation, remote repository, email list, etc."
