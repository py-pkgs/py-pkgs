    "We recommend installing the latest version of Python via the Anaconda distribution by following the instructions in the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). Anaconda is a Python distribution that includes Python, the `conda`  package and environment manager, and a number of commonly used Python libraries and dependencies. If you'd prefer to install packages as you need them, feel free to install Python via the [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution instead, which is a lightweight version of Anaconda that essentially comes with Python, `conda` and only a few key packages. If you have previosuly installed the Anaconda or Miniconda distribution, ensure that Python and `conda` are up to date by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with `conda`, it is a piece of software that simplifies the process of installing and updating software (like Python packages). It is also an environment manager which is the key function we'll be using it for in this text. An environment manager helps you create \"virtual environments\" on your machine where you can safely install different packages and their dependencies in an isolated location. Installing all the packages you need in the same place (i.e., the system default location) can be problematic, because different packages have different dependencies, and as you install more packages, you'll inevitably get conflicts between packages and your code will start to break. Virtual environments help you compartmentalise and isolate the packages you are using for different projects to avoid this issue. While alternative package and environment managers exist, we choose to use `conda` in this book because of its popularity, ease-of-use, and ability to handle any software stack (not just Python!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've installed the Anaconda distribution, use `conda` to install `poetry` ([a package](https://python-poetry.org/) that will help us build our own Python packages) and `cookiecutter` ([a package](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) that will help us create packages from pre-made templates) with the following command:\n",

A version control system tracks changes to the file(s) of your project in a clear and organised way (no more \"document_1.doc\", \"document_1_new.doc\", \"document_final.doc\", etc.). A VCS works by storing a master copy of your project in a \"repository\" which you don’t edit directly. Instead, you edit a copy of the project file(s), and then *commit* changes back to the repository. In this way, a VCS contains a full history of all the revisions made to your project which you can view and retrieve at any time.\n",

Git will help us track changes to our project on our local computers, but what if we want to collaborate with others? Or, what happens if our computer crashes? That's where GitHub comes in. GitHub is one of many online services for hosting Git-managed projects. GitHub helps you create an online version of your local Git repository which acts as a back-up of your local work and allows others to easily and transparently collaborate on your project.
