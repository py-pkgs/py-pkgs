    "General docstring convention in Python is described in [PEP 257 - Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). Docstrings are documentation included as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method in Python. Docstrings in Python are surrounded by triple-quotes, but other than that, there is flexibility in how you write your docstring. There are many different docstring style conventions used in Python. The exact style you use is important for helping you to render your documentation locally and remotely (more on that in the next section). The main styles currently in use are restructured text/sphinx style, google style, and NumPy style. Examples of each of these styles can be found [here](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Presently, we recommend the use of NumPy style documentation strings due to their readability and prevalance in many open-source Python projects.\n",

Note that there is specific syntax and spacing for defining each element of your documentation - although most of the time, you will simply be copy-pasting docstring templates and won't need to worry about remembering every detail. Each of the elements in the above numbered list is denoted by parentheses, e.g., `(1)`, in the docstring below to help you identify the different parts of the docstring - these numbers are only for demonstration purposes and are not part of a standard docstring.\n",

    "Now that you've gone to the effort of documenting your package and code, the next step is to combine all of this documentation into a clean, readable \"document\". This is important to help users explore and understand the functionality of your package without having to search through the source code or package directory structure. [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is the main documentation generator used by the Python community (but note that it also works with, e.g., R, Java, PHP). Sphinx is based on reStructuredText, a lightweight markup language that works similar to Markdown but with different syntax. Many of the files we'll use in this section to build our documentation are in `.rst` format. While we won't focus on teaching the reStructuredText syntax here, if you open up one of these files, you'll find that editing them is quite intuitive - if you wish to learn more about reStructuredText, we point you to the [Sphinx documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) which provides a comprehensive guide to reStructuredText syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your documentation typically lives in a subdirectory called `docs` in the root package directory. At a minimum this `docs` subdirectory typically includes a `conf.py` file (which configures how Sphinx reads and builds your documentation), an `index.rst` file (a master document which will serve as the \"welcome page\" of your documentation and typically includes a “table of contents” linking to the various parts of your documentation), and a `Makefile` and `make.bat` file which help Sphinx to build your documentation. Other than these files, you can include as many additional files into your `docs` subdirectory as you like. The [MDS Cookiecutter template](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/cookiecutter-ubc-mds) that we downloaded and used in {ref}`02-whole-game` automatically created the `docs` subdirectory for you, and populated it with a number of files to help you quickly build your documentation.
