    "Python packages are generally shared via the [PyPI package index](https://pypi.org/). However, when we are just starting to develop packages, and/or at the development stage of our package, we typically first check that everything works by submitting to [testPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/). `poetry` has a command called `publish` which we can use to do this, however the default behaviour is to publish to PyPI. So we need to add testPyPI to the list of repositories `poetry` knows about via:\n",
