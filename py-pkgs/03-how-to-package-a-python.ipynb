We now have a problem. When installing our package we have an impossible version resolution: matplotlib > 3 < 4 and matplotlib > 4. This issuse starts to become far more of a problem as the number of dependencies increases. For begginers, if this all seems a little overwhelming don't worry.

With a plain-text markup language, documents are written in plain-text and a special syntax is used to specify how the text should be formatted when it is rendered by a suitable tool. We'll show an example of this below, but we'll be using the Markdown language in this book because it is widely used, and we feel it has a less verbose and more intuitive syntax than reStructuredText (check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) to learn more about Markdown syntax).\n",

    "2. Recall that `poetry` installs package in \"editable mode\", such that a link to the package's location is installed, rather than an independent distribution of the package itself. This is useful for *development purposes*, because it means that any changes to the source code will be immediately reflected when you next `import` the package, without the need to `poetry install` again. However, for *users* of your package (including yourself using your package in other projects), it is often better to install a \"non-editable\" version of the package (the default behavior when you `pip install` an sdist or wheel) because a non-editable installation will remain stable and immune to any changes made to the source files on your computer."

    "This chapter provided a practical overview of the key steps required to generate a fully-featured Python package. In the following chapters, we'll explore each of these steps in more detail and continue to add features to our `pycounts` package. Two key workflows we have yet to discuss are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Releasing new versions of your package as you update it. We'll discuss this in **Chapter 7: {ref}`07:Releasing-and-versioning`**.\n",
    "2. Setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) — that is, automated pipelines for running tests, building documentation, and deploying your package. We'll discuss CI/CD in **Chapter 8: {ref}`08:Continuous-integration-and-deployment`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving onto the next chapter, let's summarize a reference list of all the steps we took to develop a Python package in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create package structure using a `cookiecutter` template (**{numref}`03:Creating-a-package-structure`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{prompt} bash \\$ auto\n",
    "    $ cookiecutter \\\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. (Optional) Put your package under version control (**{numref}`03:Put-your-package-under-version-control`**).\n",
    "3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment using `conda` (**{numref}`03:Create-a-virtual-environment`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{prompt} bash \\$ auto\n",
    "    $ conda create --name <your-env-name> python=3.9 -y\n",
    "    $ conda activate <your-env-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Add Python code to module(s) in the *`src/`* directory (**{numref}`03:Packaging-your-code`**), adding dependencies as needed (**{numref}`03:Adding-dependencies-to-your-package`**).\n",
    "\n",

    "    $ poetry add <dependency>\n",

Add `pytest` as a development dependency to run your tests (**{numref}`03:Running-tests`**). Add `pytest-cov` as a development dependency to calculate the coverage of your tests (**{numref}`03:Code-coverage`**).\n",

    "    $ pytest tests/ --cov=<pkg-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. (Optional) Create documentation source files for your package (**{numref}`03:Package-documentation`**). Use `sphinx` to compile and generate an HTML render of your documentation, adding the required development dependencies (**{numref}`03:Building-documentation`**).\n",
    "    \n",

    "    $ make html\n",
    "    $ cd ..\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. (Optional) Host documentation online with [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) (**{numref}`03:Hosting-documentation-online`**).\n",
    "9. (Optional) Tag a release of your package using Git and GitHub, or equivalent version control tools (**{numref}`03:Tagging-a-package-release-with-version-control`**).\n",
    "10. Build sdist and wheel distributions for your package (**{numref}`03:Building-your-package`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{prompt} bash \\$ auto\n",
    "    $ poetry build\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. (Optional) Publish your distributions to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) and try installing your package (**{numref}`03:Publishing-to-TestPyPI`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{prompt} bash \\$ auto\n",

    "      https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n",

    "      <pkg-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. (Optional) Publish your distributions to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Your package can now be installed by anyone using `pip` (**{numref}`03:Publishing-to-PyPI`**).\n",

    "The above workflow uses a particular suite of tools (e.g., `conda`, `poetry`, `sphinx`, etc.) to develop a Python package. While there are other tools that can be used to help build Python packages, the aim of this book is to give a high-level, practical, and efficient introduction to Python packaging using modern tools, and this has influenced our selection of tools in this chapter and book. However, the concepts and workflow discussed here remain relevant to the Python packaging ecosystem, regardless of the exact tools you use to develop your Python packages."
