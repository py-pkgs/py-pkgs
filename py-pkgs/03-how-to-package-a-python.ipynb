    "The example package we are going to create in this chapter will help us simulate guest attendance at an event - we'll call it `partpy`. Have you ever planned a party, a wedding, a conference, or any other kind of event and wondered how many of the invited guess will actually show up? Knowing this can be helpful for organising seating, catering, gifts, etc. at your event. One way we can estimate that number is by using simulations. The general idea is to assign a \"probability of attendance\" to each invited guest and then run virtual versions of our event (simulations) where we model each guest's attendance based on the probability we assigned them. We can repeat this process as many times as we like to estimate how many guests will attend our event.\n",

    "The first thing we need to do to develop our `partypy` package is create an appropriate directory structure. Without getting too technical, a Python package is just a collection of Python modules. A module is a file with a *.py* extension that contains Python definitions and statements such as functions, classes, variables or executable statements. The code you wish to easily reuse and/or share as part of your package will be contained within your package's modules. Along with these Python modules, packages typically include additional files for documentation, tests, and other metadata that together, define a self-contained, shareable, and interpretable piece of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss modules and Python package structure in more detail in **Chapter 4: {ref}`04:Package-structure-and-state`**. While you can create your Python package structure from scratch if you know what you're doing, it's typically much easier to use a pre-made template to set up your package structure - that's what we'll do here. We will use the Python package `cookiecutter` (which you installed back in **Chapter 2: {ref}`02:System-setup`**) to quickly create our package structure for us.\n",

People have developed and open-sourced many different `cookiecutter` templates for different projects, such as for creating Python packages, R packages, websites, etc. You can find these templates by, for example, searching online repositories on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com). We have developed our own `cookiecutter` [template](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/cookiecutter-ubc-mds) for creating Python packages to supplement this book. To use the `cookiecutter` template to set up the structure of our Python package, open up a terminal, change into the directory where you want your package to live and run the line of code below:\n",

Package names on PyPI must be unique. As a result, **if you plan to follow along with this tutorial you should choose a unique name for your package**.
