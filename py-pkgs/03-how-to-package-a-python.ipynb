    "Versioning is the practice of assigning a unique identifier to unique releases of a package. For example, [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)\\index{semantic versioning} is a common versioning system that consists of three integers `A.B.C`. `A` is the \"major\" version, `B` is the \"minor\" version, and `C` is the \"patch\" version identifier. Package versions usually starts at 0.1.0 and positively increment the major, minor, and patch numbers from there, depending on the kind of changes made to the package over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk more about versioning in **Chapter 7: {ref}`07:Releasing-and-versioning`**, but what's important to know now is that we typically constrain the required version number(s) of our package's dependencies, to ensure we're using versions that are up-to-date and contain the functionality we need. You may have noticed `poetry` prepended a caret (^) operator to the dependency versions in our *`pyproject.toml`* file, under the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[tool.poetry.dependencies]\n",
    "python = \"^3.11\"\n",
    "matplotlib = \"^3.10.0\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The caret operator is short-hand for \"requires this or any higher version that does not modify the left-most non-zero version digit\". For example, our package depends on any Python version >=3.11.0 and <4.0.0. Thus, examples of valid versions include 3.11.1 and 3.12.0, but 4.0.1 would be invalid. There are many other syntaxes that can be used to specify version constraints in different ways, as you can read more about in the `poetry` [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification). So why do we care about this? The caret operator enforces an upper cap on the dependency versions our package requires. A problem with this approach is that it forces anyone depending on your package to specify the same constraints and can thus make it difficult to add and resolve dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is best shown by example. Version 1.21.5 of the popular `numpy`{cite:p}`harris2020array` package had bound version constraints on Python, requiring version >=3.7 and <3.11 (see the [source code](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/c3d0a09342c08c466984654bc4738af595fba896/setup.py#L409)). Watch what happens if we try to add this version of `numpy` to our `pycounts` package (we use the argument `--dry-run` to show what would happen here without actually executing anything):\n",

However, `numpy` 1.21.5 only supports >=3.7 and <3.11 which would not be compatible with Python 3.12.0 (or any version >=3.11). As a result of this inconsistency, `poetry` refuses to add `numpy` 1.21.5 as a dependency of our package. To add it, we have three main choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the Python version constraints of our package to >=3.7 and <3.11.\n",
    "2. Wait for a version of `numpy` that is compatible with our package's Python constraints.\n",
    "3. Manually specify the versions of Python for which the dependency can be installed, e.g.: `poetry add numpy=1.21.5 --python \">=3.7, <3.11\"`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "None of these options is really ideal, especially if your package has a large number of dependencies with different bound version constraints. However, a simple way this issue could be resolved is if `numpy` 1.21.5 did not having an upper cap on the Python version required. In fact, in the subsequent minor version release of `numpy`, 1.22.0, the upper version cap on Python was removed, requiring only version >=3.8 (see the [source code](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/4adc87dff15a247e417d50f10cc4def8e1c17a03/setup.py#L410)), which we would be able to successfully add to our package:\n",

    "``` \n",

    "Ultimately, version constraints are an important issue that can affect the usability of your package. If you intend to share your package, having an upper cap on dependency versions can make it very difficult for other developers to use your package as a dependency in their own projects. At the time of writing, much of the packaging community, including the [Python Packaging Authority](https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/pull/850), generally recommend not using an upper cap on version constraints unless absolutely necessary. As a result, we recommend specifying version constraints without an upper cap by manually changing `poetry`'s default caret operator (^) to a greater-than-or-equal-to sign (>=). For example, we will change the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section of our *`pyproject.toml`* file as follows:\n",

Thus, unless `mdit-py-plugins` removes this upper cap, the easiest way for us to add `myst-nb` is to tell `poetry` to only install it for Python versions ^3.11 (i.e., >=3.9 and <4.0), by using the argument `--python \"^3.11\"`.\n",

    "Note in the output above how installing from an sdist requires a build step prior to installation. The sdist is first built into a wheel, which is then installed. For those interested, we discuss the nuances of building and installing packages from sdists and wheels in **{numref}`04:Package-distribution-and-installation`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a distribution for our package is most useful if we make it available on an online repository like the Python Package Index (PyPI\\index{PyPI}), the official online software repository for Python. This would allow users to simply run `pip install pycounts` to install our package, without needing the sdist or wheel files locally, and we'll do this in the next section. But even if you don't intend to share your package, it can still be useful to build and install distributions for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A distribution is a self-contained copy of your package's source files that's easy to move around and store on your computer. It makes it easy to retain distributions for different versions of your package, so that you can re-use or share them if you ever need to.\n",
    "2. Recall that `poetry` installs package in \"editable mode\", such that a link to the package's location is installed, rather than an independent distribution of the package itself. This is useful for *development purposes*, because it means that any changes to the source code will be immediately reflected when you next `import` the package, without the need to `poetry install` again. However, for *users* of your package (including yourself using your package in other projects), it is often better to install a \"non-editable\" version of the package (the default behavior when you `pip install` an sdist or wheel) because a non-editable installation will remain stable and immune to any changes made to the source files on your computer."

If your package depends on packages that are not on TestPyPI you can tell `pip` to try and look for them on PyPI instead. To do that, you can use the argument `--extra-index-url` as we do in the command above."

In the following chapters, we'll explore each of these steps in more detail and continue to add features to our `pycounts` package. Two key workflows we have yet to discuss are:\n",

    "1. Releasing new versions of your package as you update it. We'll discuss this in **Chapter 7: {ref}`07:Releasing-and-versioning`**.\n",

While there are other tools that can be used to help build Python packages, the aim of this book is to give a high-level, practical, and efficient introduction to Python packaging using modern tools, and this has influenced our selection of tools in this chapter and book. However, the concepts and workflow discussed here remain relevant to the Python packaging ecosystem, regardless of the exact tools you use to develop your Python packages."
