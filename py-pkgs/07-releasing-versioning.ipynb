Most of the time, users will want to use the most up-to-date version of your package, but sometimes, they'll need to use an older version that is compatible with their project.

    "Versioning\\index{versioning} is the process of adding unique identifiers to different versions of your package. The unique identifier you use may be name-based or number-based, but most Python packages use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)\\index{semantic versioning}. In semantic versioning, a version number consists of three integers A.B.C, where A is the \"major\" version, B is the \"minor\" version, and C is the \"patch\" version. The first version of a software usually starts at 0.1.0 and increments from there. We call an increment a \"bump\", and it consists of adding 1 to either the major, minor, or patch identifier as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Patch** release\\index{versioning!patch} (0.1.0 -> 0.1.**1**): patch releases are typically used for bug fixes, which are backward compatible. Backward compatibility refers to the compatibility of your package with previous versions of itself. For example, if a user was using v0.1.0 of your package, they should be able to upgrade to v0.1.1 and have any code they previously wrote still work. It's fine to have so many patch releases that you need to use two digits (e.g., 0.1.27).\n",
    "- **Minor** release\\index{versioning!minor} (0.1.0 -> 0.**2**.0): a minor release typically includes larger bug fixes or new features that are backward compatible, for example, the addition of a new function. It's fine to have so many minor releases that you need to use two digits (e.g., 0.13.0).\n",
    "- **Major** release\\index{versioning!major} (0.1.0 -> **1**.0.0): release 1.0.0 is typically used for the first stable release of your package. After that, major releases are made for changes that are not backward compatible and may affect many users. Changes that are not backward compatible are called \"breaking changes\". For example, changing the name of one of the modules in your package would be a breaking change; if users upgraded to your new package, any code they'd written using the old module name would no longer work, and they would have to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you'll be making patch and minor releases. We'll discuss major releases, breaking changes\\index{breaking change}, and how to deprecate package functionality (i.e., remove it) more in **{numref}`07:Breaking-changes-and-deprecating-package-functionality`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the guidelines above, versioning a package can be a little subjective and requires you to use your best judgment. For example, small packages might make a patch release for each individual bug fixed or a minor release for each new feature added. In contrast, larger packages will often group multiple bug fixes into a single patch release or multiple features into a single minor release, because making a release for every individual change would result in an overwhelming and confusing amount of releases! {numref}`07-release-table` shows some practical examples of major, minor, and patch releases made for the Python software itself. To formalize the circumstances under which different kinds of releases should be made, some developers create a \"version policy\" document for their package; the `pandas` [version policy](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/policies.html#version-policy) is a good example of this.\n",
