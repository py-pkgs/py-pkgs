    "In general, the goal of testing is to check that your code produces the results you expect it to. You probably already conduct informal tests of your code in your current workflow. In a typical workflow, we write code, run it in a Python session to see if it's working as we expect, make changes, repeat. This is sometimes called \"manual testing\" or \"exploratory testing\" and is common in the early stages of development of your code. But when developing code you intend to package up, reuse, and potentially share with others, you'll want to test it in a more formal and reproducible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, tests are usually written using an `assert` statement, which checks the truth of a given expression, and returns a user-defined error message if the statement is false. To demonstrate this process, imagine we want to create a function called `count_letters()` that counts the number of letters in a string. We come up with the following code as a first version of that function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def count_letters(text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Count letters in a string.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return len(text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write some tests for that function using the `assert` statement to check it's working as we expect it to. For example we would expect our function to calculate 5 letters in the string `\"Hello\"` and 10 letters in the string `\"Hello world\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prompt} python >>> auto\n",
    ">>> assert count_letters(\"Hello\") == 5, \"'Hello' should have 5 letters\"\n",
    ">>> assert count_letters(\"Hello world\") == 10, \"'Hello world' should have 10 letters\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ran the above `assert` statements, the first would pass without error, but the second would throw an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "AssertionError: 'Hello world' should have 10 letters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What went wrong? When we call `len()` on a string, it counts all the characters in the string, including the spaces. So, we need to go back to our `count_letters()` function and remove spaces before counting letters. One way we can do this is by using the `.replace()` method to replace spaces with an empty string (i.e., nothing):\n",

    "\n",
    "In our earlier demonstration with the `count_letters()` function, we swapped step 1 and 2; we wrote the first version of our function's code before we wrote our tests, and this is a common workflow too. However, you can see how it might have been beneficial to write the tests (or at least think about them) before writing the code; if we knew we were testing text with a space in it, we might have included that in our function in the first place. Writing your tests before your code is known as \"test-driven development\" and advocates of this approach suggest that it helps you better understand the code you need to write, prevent bugs, and ultimately save you time. However in practice, writing your tests first or last doesn't seem to have a significant impact on overall development time {cite:p}`fucci2016`. Regardless of when you choose to formally write your tests, all developers should at least think about the specifications of their code before they write it. What might the inputs look like? What will the output look like? Are there any [edge cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case) to consider? Taking a moment to consider and write down these specifications will help you write code effectively and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the testing workflow is all about working incrementally and iteratively. The idea is to make small changes to your code as you add features or identify bugs, test it, write more tests, repeat. Managing and executing such a workflow manually like we did above would clearly be inefficient. Instead, a test framework is typically used to help manage the testing workflow in an efficient, automated, and reproducible way. `pytest` is one of the most common test frameworks for Python packages. We used it to help test our `pycounts` package in **{numref}`03:Running-tests`**. In the rest of this chapter we'll continue to explore how `pytest` can be used to test your package and will demonstrate concepts by building on the `pycounts` package."

    "The short answer is that fixtures provide far more functionality and reliability than manually defined variables. For example, each time you use a `pytest` fixture, it triggers the fixture function, meaning that each test gets a fresh copy of the data; you don't have to worry about accidentally mutating or deleting your fixture during a test. However, you can also control this behaviour; should the fixture be executed once per call, once per module, or once per session? This can be helpful if the fixture is large or time-consuming to create. Finally, we've only explored the use of fixtures as data for a test, but fixtures can also be used to set up the environment for a test. For example, the directory structure a test should run in, or the environment variables it should have access to. `pytest` fixtures can help you easily set up these kinds of contexts, as you can read more about in the `pytest` [documentation](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fixture.html)."
