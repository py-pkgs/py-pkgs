In this chapter we'll first walk through setting up CI and CD for a Python package, with the help of GitHub Actions.

    "You could manually write and execute a CI/CD workflow by, for example, writing scripts that execute all of the steps we've walked through in previous chapters (i.e., running tests, building documented, build package, etc.). However, this process is not efficient or scalable, and it does not work well if more than one person (i.e., you) is contributing to your code. It is therefore more common to use a CI/CD service to implement CI/CD. These services essentially do what we described above but in an automated manner; we define a workflow which these services will automatically run at certain \"trigger events\" which we can also define (for example, making a pull request to the main branch of a GitHub repository might trigger the automatic deployment of a new version of the software).\n",

If you need to do something in your workflow, like install `poetry`, the chances are that somebody has already created an action for that which contains all the code needed to install `poetry` and which we we can use in our workflow without having to write the code ourselves.

    "The first thing we want to check is that any new code adheres to a style guide. We haven't discussed code style in this book yet, but it's useful to know about. Code style is about making your code adhere to a set of guidelines in an effort to make it as readable and consistent as possible. Remember, \"Code is read much more often than it is written\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Style Guide is outlined in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). It is also important when sharing and collaborating on your code with other users (including your future self!), to ensure that code is written in a uniform way across the package. It is worth taking the time to read through the PEP 8 style guidelines, but here are a few highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indent using 4 spaces;\n",
    "- Have white space around operators, e.g. `x = 1` not `x=1`;\n",

    "./src/partypy/__init__.py:10:56: W292 no newline at end of file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",

    "In the output above we can see that `flake8` noticed several style violations (if you've been following along with the `partypy` example in this book, the violations you see might still be slightly different to those above depending on how you formatted your code). These violations can be fixed by opening the code files in an editor and addressing the issues, however we'll refrain from doing that for now, so we can demonstrate what a failed CI workflow looks like later on.\n",

One of the most commonly used formatters at the moment is [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",

    "As we went through in **Chapter 7: {ref}`07:Releasing-and-versioning`**, to create a new release of our package we typically do a few key things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bump the package version depending on whether we have a patch, minor, or major release;\n",
    "2. Document what's changed in the new release in the *`CHANGELOG.md`*; and,\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to use the [Python Semantic Release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (PSR) tool to help us automate these steps. Put simply, PSR is able to parse commit messages to determine what the next version of the package should be. The idea is to used a standardized commit message format and syntax which PSR can parse to determine how to increment the version number. The parser is customizable but follows the [Angular commit style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commit-message-format) by default, which we've actually been using throughout this book. In this style if a commit message is prefixed with \"fix\" or \"perf\" (performance) a patch version bump will be made. If a commit message is prefixed with \"feat\" (feature) a minor bump will be made. If a message contains \"BREAKING CHANGE:\" a major bump will occur. There are other commit message types too, such as \"doc\" and \"style\" which don't be default result in a version bump (but can be configured to do so if desired).\n",
    "\n",
    "The PSR tool is not only able to automatically bump our package version based on commit messages, but it can also automatically update our *`CHANGELOG.md`* using the commits since the last release and make a new release of our source on GitHub. We'll add PSR as a step in our CD workflow shortly but first, we'll configure it from our *`pyproject.toml`* file by adding the following section:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[tool.semantic_release]\n",

    "changelog_file = \"CHANGELOG.md\"             # the file we want PSR to update with changes\n",
    "build_command = false                       # don't build package (we'll do this later)\n",

    "We've added comments above to provide clarity on what each line is doing and you can read more about these different configuration options in the [PSR documentation](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html). As you can see, PSR is able to build and upload your package to PyPI automatically as well, but we chose to disable this functionality because in our CD workflow we are going to build our package ourselves and first upload to TestPyPI, make sure we can install it correctly from there, and only then will we upload to PyPI.\n",

    "Overall, CI/CD is a great way to streamline your package development and open-source collaboration. In this chapter we've walked through a simple CI/CD workflow for a Python package using tools like `poetry`, GitHub Actions, and Python Semantic Release. These, and other, tools can be configured in many different ways to achieve almost any workflow imaginable!"
