However, if someone adds new code to your package but forgets to write tests for that new code, your existing tests will still pass, but the coverage will be reduced. So, we probably want to track code coverage in our CI workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we could print the coverage to our runner's build log, but having the coverage buried in those logs is not overly helpful. Instead, it's common to use a service like [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) to track our code coverage for us. To set up Codecov, first create a Codecov account by linking it with your GitHub account, as described in the Codecov [documentation](https://docs.codecov.com/docs) (Codecov also supports GitLab and Bitbucket). Once you've done this, Codecov automatically syncs with all the repositories that you have access to. Now, to use Codecov to automatically track code coverage as part of our CI workflow we can use the action they've created called [codecov/codecov-action@v2](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/codecov), as below:\n",

    "With this step in our workflow, coverage will automatically be recorded for each new proposed change to our code. Codecov can show you whether coverage has increased or decreased, by how much, and will link to relevant areas of your package's source code. This information will automatically appear on any pull request someone makes to the `main` branch on GitHub, or it can be viewed anytime on the Codecov website; for example, {numref}`08-cov-fig` shows the coverage dashboard for a package called `pypkgs`, where coverage decreased significantly after the most recent commit.\n",

However, changes to your package are more typically made on branches. Branches isolate your changes so you can develop your package without affecting the existing, stable version. Only when you're happy with your changes and they've passed CI, do you merge them into the existing source and trigger a CD workflow (if it exists). In collaborative environments, this is typically done via a \"pull request\", which you can read more about in the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
